# Big-Number-Calculator
Hey There ...

This is my First School HomeWork , 
which is a Calculator that can Subtract, Add, Divide, Multiply ...

and also it can calculate intagrals of phrases that contain sum of 'x^n' (power of n, x) functions.

and it also can draw the Linear functions like (ax + b)...

> **_NOTE:_**  You Can Type Numbers (you are not allowed to type other stuff like "=", "*", etc).
